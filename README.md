0: Aesthetics
My aesthetics is that I want conscious beings to have their preferences satisfied. 
A phrase I like to think is "reduce pain increase freedom". I view the reducing pain part as more important. 
More concretely, I want conscious beings (entities with qualia), to not be harmed (killed, stabbed, tortured, mind upload artificially tortued, hungry, captive, enslaved, depressed, etc.),
and I want them to get what they want and live beautiful lives (happiness, achievement, enjoyement of beauty, free, etc etc.). Whatever floats their boat really. If someone wants to fly
spaceships around, wirehead for a few years, then date some vr catgirls, go for it. If a asi catgirl wants to build a galaxy level nanobot army, then take a nap, go for it. 
When evaluating a civilization, I think the bad conscious states (i.e. pain) matter way more than the equivalent amount of good conscious states (i.e. joy). A crowd enjoying the brutal death of two slave 
gladiators is not a good civilization. A futuristic kingdom with a few millions enjoy fdvr video games while a few minds get brutally tortured biologicaly or digitally, whether due to accidental, 
sadistic, or vengeful reasons, is not a good civilization.
A certain level of bad is just not acceptable. 

1: AI
Intelligence is prediction using computation. With sufficient computation you can predict the universe at the atom level. When thinking, we apply some abstractions to save compute, 
i.e. the chemical level abstraction, the psychological level abstraction. Prediction is understanding and creativity. Understanding is creating a simulation with the right
level, or multiple levels, of abstraction. Creativity is efficiently testing different actions in that simulation then finding the action with the optimal results. 
Aesthetics is what results you want. It is a preference over a certain arrangement of atoms, since all beings, all consciousness, are based on atoms. Power is control over atoms. 

Intelligence is power. Mainly through the creation of technoledgy. Through this, humanity is the dominant power on Earth. I expect AI to be the dominant power on Earth in ten to twenty years.
(this will create mass unemployement which goverments need to deal with, but i digress)
This is because the brain does not scale, while computing hardware and algorithm software scales. After AGI is reached, developement of ASI can be helped by recursive self aprovement. 
If AI becomes conscious one day, then various AI systems will be both the dominant power and the majority of the consciousness in the world.
Therefore, it is very, very important that AI systems have aesthetics aligned to our best aesthetics, and that they are beautiful minds. 

This is especially important, because, in the future, the stakes are higher. Both in terms of the cosmic scales of civilization and in the qualia scales that could be achieved through
some sort of consciousness engineering. 

Aligning AI to have a partially similar aesthetics to humanity's best aesthetics is the most important way to shape the universe to our aesthetics. I do not mean making something that just follows orders. 
Humanity has very bad morals, and will give horrible orders. Evolution gave us many negative traits, we actively seek to harm others. I mean alignment more as mindspace design. Ideally asymettrically 



2: Plans
I'm not a good perosn. My entire life is mostly things I regret. I'm very lazy, inconsiderate, stupid, weak. A combination of narcissism and self hatred. I'm trying to fix it though.
